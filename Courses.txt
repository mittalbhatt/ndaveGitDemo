We prepared angular Automation s script in node js for angular 16 and we prepared ng build with 2 approach one is buic bundle approch in we use custome webpack and second one is element bundle apporch so after execute action script entire buic ready with these 2 approch just developer need to fix lint error and angular related changes in src app main folder after fix all this changes build will generate automatic in dist folder with 2 approch and also basic configuration for politics angular.json and lint related and bundle related changes automatic done by angualr Automation script ...pls give ppt content for one page like concept ,problem statement, solutions ,benifits

Here’s a suggestion for your one-page PPT content, based on the provided details:

Concept
Automation of Angular 16 builds using Node.js script with two approaches: BUIC Bundle (Custom Webpack) and Element Bundle.

Problem Statement
Manual build processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and require repeated lint fixes and configuration updates for every deployment. Developers need to ensure that bundling, linting, and configurations are accurate before generating the final build.

Solution
An Angular automation script in Node.js that streamlines the build process using two approaches:

BUIC Bundle Approach: Utilizes custom Webpack for advanced bundling.
Element Bundle Approach: Offers a standard bundling process.
After executing the script:

Lint errors and Angular-related changes in the src/app/main folder are automatically highlighted.
The build is automatically generated in the dist folder for both approaches.
Configurations in angular.json, lint, and bundling are automatically updated.
Benefits
Time Efficiency: Eliminates manual configuration and lint fixing, allowing developers to focus on code quality.
Consistency: Ensures uniform build processes and linting standards across projects.
Automation: Reduces human error, automating both custom Webpack and element bundling.
Simplified Process: Developers only need to fix lint errors; the rest is handled by the script.
This one-page format keeps the content concise and easy to present!

Above angular buic generation developer need to do manual configuration and it take 3 hours or more time because for 2 approch have around 25 steps and some developer not have knowledge of how to merch this two approch it will take entire day pls include this in shirt way in above ppt content

Here’s the updated one-page PPT content with the additional details about the manual configuration:

Concept
Automation of Angular 16 builds using Node.js script with two approaches: BUIC Bundle (Custom Webpack) and Element Bundle.

Problem Statement
The manual build process for Angular projects is complex and time-consuming. Developers need to follow around 25 steps for two different approaches (BUIC and Element), which can take over 3 hours. For developers unfamiliar with merging these approaches, the process can extend to an entire day.

Solution
An Angular automation script in Node.js that streamlines the build process using two approaches:

BUIC Bundle Approach: Utilizes custom Webpack for advanced bundling.
Element Bundle Approach: Offers a standard bundling process.
After executing the script:

Lint errors and Angular-related changes in the src/app/main folder are automatically highlighted.
The build is automatically generated in the dist folder for both approaches.
Configurations in angular.json, lint, and bundling are automatically updated, reducing the need for manual steps.
Benefits
Time Efficiency: Automates the entire configuration process, cutting down the time from 3+ hours (or a full day) to just a few minutes.
Consistency: Ensures uniform build processes and linting standards across projects.
Automation: Reduces human error, automating both custom Webpack and element bundling.
Simplified Process: Developers only need to fix lint errors; the rest is handled by the script, even for those unfamiliar with both approaches.
