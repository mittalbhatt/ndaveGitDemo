"Our current approach for upgrading BUIC from Angular 2 to 10 or 16 involves three main steps: First, developers need to install Angular dependencies to generate the basic BUIC schema. Second, to generate the minified or compressed bundle file, we rely on a Webpack approach where developers have to install Webpack dependencies manually and customize Angular common files, following ETP standards. This process involves around 20 steps. Third, for making BUIC a reusable component, we use Angular Elements, requiring additional dependencies and customization. On top of that, developers manually configure Husky checkmarks and Content Security Policy (CSP). To streamline this process and reduce manual efforts, we created an automation script that integrates all these approaches into a single, automated workflow, making the process much more efficient for developers.
